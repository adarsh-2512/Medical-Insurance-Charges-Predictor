# Medical Insurance Charges Prediction

This project is a **Medical Insurance Charges Predictor** that uses a **Random Forest Regression** model to predict the insurance charges based on several features like age, sex, BMI, smoker status, and region. The model is trained using the `RandomForestRegressor` from `scikit-learn` and deployed using a **Streamlit** web application.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to predict medical insurance charges for individuals based on demographic and lifestyle factors. It uses a trained Random Forest Regression model and a user-friendly web interface built using **Streamlit** to input user data and display predictions in real time.

## Features

- Predicts insurance costs based on user inputs such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - BMI (Body Mass Index)
  - Number of children
  - Smoker status
  - Region
- Provides a clean and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the model.
- The prediction is based on a trained **Random Forest** model, which provides high accuracy.
